## Javascript

#### Data types:
1. **Number** - for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±(253-1).  
 Also Infinity, -Infinity and NaN.
2. **Bigint** - for integer numbers of arbitrary length. More then (253-1). 
3. **String** - string for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
4. **Boolean** - for true/false logical type.
5. **Null** - for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null. Empty value. 
6. **Undefined** - for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined. Value is not assigned. 
7. **Symbol** - for unique identifiers.
8. **Object** - complex data structures.

To define data type `typeof x`, but `typeof null -> object`, it's language mistake.
