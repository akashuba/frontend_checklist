## Javascript

#### Data types:
1. **Number** - for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±(253-1).  
 Also Infinity, -Infinity and NaN.
2. **Bigint** - for integer numbers of arbitrary length. More then (253-1). 
3. **String** - string for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
4. **Boolean** - for true/false logical type.
5. **Null** - for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null. Empty value. 
6. **Undefined** - for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined. Value is not assigned. 
7. **Symbol** - for unique identifiers.
8. **Object** - complex data structures.

To define data type `typeof x`, but `typeof null -> object`, it's language mistake. 

#### Javascript features:
* **dynamic typesation** - allow to redefine variable and change it type. Variable connected to the value by assigning, but by defining. 
* **weak typing** - in case of type conversion.
* **automation memory management** - controlled by garbage collector. Variables and objects are deleted when they aren't reachable. 
* **prototype programming** - Thus inheritance in JavaScript is covered by a delegation automatism that is bound to the prototype property of constructor functions.
* **functions is a first-class citizen** - functions could be used as variables and could be passed and returned on another functions.
